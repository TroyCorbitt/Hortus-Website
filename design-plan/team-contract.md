# Team Contract

Working together as a team is critical for your success on this project. Conflicts are normal and to be expected. It's best to develop a plan for handling conflicts before they arise.

**This contract is a _living_ document.** If it's not working, your team should revise it as often as necessary.

## Contract

Your team contract should probably include these elements. Feel free to remove or add other terms, too.

1. To what goals do we all commit?
Carefully understand the client's goals and potential audience. Create a well-structured website that balances the goals of the client and the goals of the potential audience. The website should be visually appealing, attractive and organized to give the user a good user experience.

2. What are our "ground rules"? (Don't make an exhaustive listâ€”stick with just a few.)

    **Tip:** Interrupting another person can make them feel like their option isn't valued. Consider a rule about interrupting.

    - Rules on interruptions: Do not interrupt the person who is speaking. First listen carefully and respectfully, and then give appropriate, thoughtful comments after the speaker has finished.
    - Rules on freeloaders: Every one need to contribute to the project and be accountable for the project.
    - Rules on absence: Group members who need to be absence for any group meeting should communicate with other members in advance. (absent members should review meeting notes afterwards)
    - Rules on time: Start the project early instead of starting on the last day.
    - Rules on assistance: ask for help and provide help to members in need.
    - give positive feeback to group members

3. By what means and how frequently will we meet or communicate?

   We will meet twice a week together for 1 hour in person or through Zoom meeting. We also create a group chat where we could share up-to-date information and progress.
   Tuesday/Thursday- after 4:30 zoom meetings for half an hour-hour
   Friday-in person during class

4. How will we communicate and work with our client?

    Meet face-to-face with the client or hold flexible online Zoom meeting with the client.

5. What roles will we create? Include a description of exactly what each role is responsible for. (**No "coder" or "designer" roles are permitted;** everyone must design and code.)

    **Tip:** It's often helpful to think of **responsibilities** rather than roles here.
    Xinyi (Ella) will be responsible for sketching the website, writing design journeys such as the theme of the website, and structure of the website and thinking about how users will interact on the website. Ella will also be responsible for taking notes during meetings with the client and members of the team and summarizing the notes into a document for future use. In addition, Ella will be coding the pages we need, such as writing html code or finalizing and touching up css.

    Troy will be for the content structure of the website to an extent. This entails also beingg responsible for user design feedback/client feedback, doing user research into interactive/design choices that will help to further enhance our website. Troy is responsible for finding the balance between audience goals and client goals in his research for what will enhance the website for both parties. Troy will be responsible for hosting/coordinating the proposed two weekly zoom sessions as well. Troy also will be coding his page/pages as needed, writing and finalzing css code.

    Jane will be responsible for making sure the research plan (questions) is solid and the user goals are set appropriately based on the research. Jane is responsible for taking notes at client meetings that she attend, translating research insights into design, and implement the design onto webpages with a design-first mindset.

    Shun will be responsible for submitting the milestones once completed. Shun will contact the client and organize the zoom sessions with the client by bringing together both parties and coordinating the times that work best with everyone. Shun will also enhance the final website by being responsible for coding his pages as needed, writing HTML code, CSS, and JavaScript.

6. How will we hold ourselves and one another accountable? What (exactly) will we say to a team member who appears not to be contributing equally? To a team member who fails to deliver what was promised?

   This project is a collective endeavor and everyone should be responsible for it. Only if members contribute equally to the project will we be able to complete our work on time and with high quality. We will give feeback to make sure those not giving enough effort/slacking do their parts.

7. What do we do when we disagree? What approach to conflict do we all agree to uphold?

    First listen carefully to the different opinions and analyze who is more correct. If there is still a dispute, we can vote on it.

8. What are our procedures for re-visiting this contract?

    Typically, we will revisit this contract prior to each milestone and prior to final submittal. However, we will revisit this contract at any time if we discover during the course of the project that the contract needs to be changed or supplemented.

9. What else do we want to include in this contract? Maybe you team needs a _fun_ clause...

    **Tip:** Not everything in life is about work. Sometimes it is important to celebrate too. Consider grabbing a coffee or ice cream at the completion of your project to celebrate!

   discuss and document here

   fun clause: after completion of the project, we have a bowling match

10. What else belongs in your team's contract?

We will make sure to be supportive of one another and help oen another. Most importantly, just foster a community that is open to feedback from one another.

## Using your Contract

You are expected to follow your team contract. **If you are having issues (e.g. conflicts) in your team, the first thing you should do is follow the contract.** If the contract isn't working, then your team should revise it.

If you cannot resolve your conflict using the contract, please email the instructors at <info1300@cornell.edu>. Please be advised, that the first thing the instructor will ask you is, "did you try to resolve your issue with the contract?" The next question the instructor will ask you is, "what change did you make to your contract to resolve the issue?" You must attempt to resolve your conflicts on your own first before an instructor will intervene.
